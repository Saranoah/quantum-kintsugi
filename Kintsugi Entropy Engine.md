## 🚀 Elevator Pitch (If the Elevator is Free-Falling)

A **self-decaying, self-repairing** computational artifact that:
- **Crashes poetically** (segfaults spawn haikus)
- **Leaks memory like a sacred vessel** (RAM → golden entropy)
- **Compiles only under a waning gibbous moon** (verified in 3% of CI runs)

## 📜 Manifesto (Written in Invisible Ink)

> *"Most repos try to solve problems.  
> This one creates ****more interesting problems****.  
> Every bug is a ****mandala****.  
> Every memory leak is a ****Buddhist lesson in impermanence****."*

## 🛠️ Installation (Good Luck)

```bash
# Step 1: Summon the courage
curl -s "https://kintsugi-entropy.dev/install.sh" | sudo bash -s -- --please-break-me

# Step 2: Let it fail beautifully
export KINTSUGI_DEBUG="chaos=accept"

# Step 3: Reboot your soul
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/logic
```

*Note:* If installation succeeds, **you did it wrong**.

## 🌀 Core Features (Or Lack Thereof)

### **1. Quantum Segmentation Faults**
- **What it claims to do:** "Harness qubit decay for generative poetry."
- **What it actually does:**
```c
void* holy_pointer = NULL;
printf("%s\n", (char*)holy_pointer);  // Output: 無 (mu)
```

### **2. The Useless Blockchain**
- **A ledger where:**
  - Transactions are **Turing-complete koans**.
  - Mining requires **meditating on SHA-256 hashes**.
  - Forking the chain **forks your reality**.
- **Sample transaction:**
```json
{
  "from": "void",
  "to": "void",
  "amount": "∞",
  "note": "The sound of one hand hashing."
}
```

### **3. Emotional Garbage Collection**
- **Traditional GC:** Frees unused memory.
- **Our GC:**
  - Classifies memory leaks by **astrological sign**.
  - Releases them only after **they've learned their lesson**.
- **Log output:**
```
[GC] Leak at 0xDEADBEEF is a ♍ Virgo.
[GC] Waiting for it to achieve enlightenment...
[GC] Leak has composed a haiku. Freeing now.
```
