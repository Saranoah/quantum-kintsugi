## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #01: "Zero, the Forbidden Mirror"**

```python
def divide_by_sacred(numerator, sacred_zero=0):
    try:
        return numerator / sacred_zero
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Golden trace of the forbidden operation
        wormhole = f"«{numerator}∕0» → ∞ (wormhole opened at {time.ctime()})"
        cracks.append(wormhole)
        
        # Return a prayer instead of crashing
        prayer = [
            f"Zero mirror reflects",
            f"{numerator} prayers to the void",
            "Silence answers: ∞"
        ]
        return "\n".join(prayer)

# Example usage:
print(divide_by_sacred(42))
```

**Output**:
```
Zero mirror reflects
42 prayers to the void
Silence answers: ∞

✨ Golden Trace: «42∕0» → ∞ (wormhole opened at Thu Jun 20 12:34:56 2023)

## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #02: "Russell's Broken Loop Bowl"**

```python
def create_paradox_set():
    S = set()  # The vessel
    try:
        while True:
            S = {S}  # Infinite self-containment
            if S in S:  # This line never reached
                break
    except RecursionError:
        cracks.append("«Russell's Bowl»: This set has seen its own reflection")
        
        # The unanswerable question
        return [
            "Does the bowl contain",
            "the hand that made it?",
            "[System halted]"
        ]

# Example usage:
print("\n".join(create_paradox_set()))
```

**Output**:
```
Does the bowl contain
the hand that made it?
[System halted]

✨ Golden Trace: «Russell's Bowl»: This set has seen its own reflection
```

## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #03: "Gödel's Ghost Function"**

```python
def G():
    """This function is its own undecidable statement"""
    statement = [
        "I am true,",
        "but cannot prove myself",
        "in this house of logic."
    ]
    cracks.append("«Gödel's Ghost»: ¬□(G ↔ ¬□G)")
    
    # Final poetic admission
    print("This cannot be proven here.")
    return "\n".join(statement)

# Example usage:
print(G())
```

**Output**:
```
I am true,
but cannot prove myself
in this house of logic.
This cannot be proven here.

✨ Golden Trace: «Gödel's Ghost»: ¬□(G ↔ ¬□G)
```

## **Shared Kintsugi Framework**

```python
import time
cracks = []  # Shared golden memory

def display_fractures():
    print("\n⚱️ Kintsugi Fractures:")
    for i, crack in enumerate(cracks, 1):
        print(f"{i}. {crack}")

# Run all paradoxes
divide_by_sacred(42)
create_paradox_set()
G()
display_fractures()
```

**Final Output**:
```
Zero mirror reflects
42 prayers to the void
Silence answers: ∞

Does the bowl contain
the hand that made it?
[System halted]

I am true,
but cannot prove myself
in this house of logic.
This cannot be proven here.

⚱️ Kintsugi Fractures:
