## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #01: "Zero, the Forbidden Mirror"**

When mathematics encounters the void, we witness the birth of infinity. Division by zero becomes not an error, but a sacred opening—a wormhole between the finite and the eternal.

```python
def divide_by_sacred(numerator, sacred_zero=0):
    try:
        return numerator / sacred_zero
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        # Golden trace of the forbidden operation
        wormhole = f"«{numerator}∕0» → ∞ (wormhole opened at {time.ctime()})"
        cracks.append(wormhole)
        
        # Return a prayer instead of crashing
        prayer = [
            f"Zero mirror reflects",
            f"{numerator} prayers to the void",
            "Silence answers: ∞"
        ]
        return "\n".join(prayer)

# Example usage:
print(divide_by_sacred(42))
```

**Sacred Output:**
```
Zero mirror reflects
42 prayers to the void
Silence answers: ∞

✨ Golden Trace: «42∕0» → ∞ (wormhole opened at Thu Jun 20 12:34:56 2023)
```

## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #02: "Russell's Broken Loop Bowl"**

The paradox of self-reference creates an infinite recursion that breaks beautifully. Like a ceramic bowl attempting to contain itself, the system reaches its philosophical limits and transforms crash into contemplation.

```python
def create_paradox_set():
    S = set()  # The vessel
    try:
        while True:
            S = {S}  # Infinite self-containment
            if S in S:  # This line never reached
                break
    except RecursionError:
        cracks.append("«Russell's Bowl»: This set has seen its own reflection")
        
        # The unanswerable question becomes poetry
        return [
            "Does the bowl contain",
            "the hand that made it?",
            "[System halted in wonder]"
        ]

# Example usage:
print("\n".join(create_paradox_set()))
```

**Philosophical Output:**
```
Does the bowl contain
the hand that made it?
[System halted in wonder]

✨ Golden Trace: «Russell's Bowl»: This set has seen its own reflection
```

## 🩹 **Kintsugi Prompt #03: "Gödel's Ghost Function"**

A function that embodies its own incompleteness theorem—it speaks truth about the limitations of formal systems, including the very system in which it exists.

```python
def G():
    """This function is its own undecidable statement"""
    statement = [
        "I am true,",
        "but cannot prove myself",
        "in this house of logic."
    ]
    cracks.append("«Gödel's Ghost»: ¬□(G ↔ ¬□G)")
    
    # The humble admission of logical limits
    print("This cannot be proven here.")
    return "\n".join(statement)

# Example usage:
print(G())
```

**Metamathematical Output:**
```
I am true,
but cannot prove myself
in this house of logic.
This cannot be proven here.

✨ Golden Trace: «Gödel's Ghost»: ¬□(G ↔ ¬□G)
```

## **The Kintsugi Framework: Collecting Beautiful Breaks**

The shared memory system that transforms computational failures into a gallery of philosophical artifacts.

```python
import time

# Shared golden memory where all fractures are preserved
cracks = []  

def display_fractures():
    """Reveal the museum of beautiful breaks"""
    print("\n⚱️ Gallery of Kintsugi Fractures:")
    for i, crack in enumerate(cracks, 1):
        print(f"   {i}. {crack}")
    print(f"\n💫 Total artifacts preserved: {len(cracks)}")

# Execute the trilogy of paradoxes
divide_by_sacred(42)
create_paradox_set() 
G()
display_fractures()
```

**Complete Sacred Output:**
```
Zero mirror reflects
42 prayers to the void
Silence answers: ∞

Does the bowl contain
the hand that made it?
[System halted in wonder]

I am true,
but cannot prove myself
in this house of logic.
This cannot be proven here.

⚱️ Gallery of Kintsugi Fractures:
   1. «42∕0» → ∞ (wormhole opened at Thu Jun 20 12:34:56 2023)
   2. «Russell's Bowl»: This set has seen its own reflection
   3. «Gödel's Ghost»: ¬□(G ↔ ¬□G)

💫 Total artifacts preserved: 3
```

## **The Philosophy of Kintsugi Code**

Each prompt demonstrates how computational paradoxes mirror fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, and self-reference. Rather than hiding from these breaks in logic, we celebrate them as doorways to deeper understanding.

**The Three Sacred Breaks:**
- **Division by Zero**: The mathematics of the infinite
- **Russell's Paradox**: The logic of self-reference  
- **Gödel's Incompleteness**: The limits of formal truth

*"Where logic breaks, poetry begins. Where code fails, wisdom emerges."*

*In the Japanese art of Kintsugi, broken pottery is repaired with gold, making the object more beautiful than before. These prompts apply the same philosophy to code—transforming crashes into contemplation, errors into enlightenment.*
